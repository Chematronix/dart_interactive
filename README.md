A lot of sibling languages have a REPL, and is quite helpful in everyday usage, while Dart did not have it (even though it was the [8th](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) highest-voted request). So here it comes!

## ðŸš€ Features

A full-featured REPL (interactive shell), with:

* Use any third-party package freely
* Auto hot-reload code anywhere, with state preserved
* Supports full grammar in REPL
* Play with existing code side-by-side

## ðŸ“š Demo

### Demo 1: Demonstrate features

1. Use 3rd party package

```dart
>>> !dart pub add path // normal shell command
>>> import 'package:path/path.dart'; // normal import
>>> join('directory', 'file.txt') // use it (`join` is a function in 3rd party package `path`)
directory/file.txt
```

2. Auto hot-reload

```dart
>>> import 'a.dart';
>>> myFunc()
hello, tom
// ... change content of `a.dart` ...
>>> myFunc()
hello, alex
```

3. Support full grammar

```dart
>>> a = 10;
// support rich grammar
>>> int g() => a++; class A {} class B {}
... class C extends A implements B {
...   int b = 20;
...   int f() { int c = 30; a++; b++; c++; return a+b+c+g(); }
... }
>>> c = C()
>>> c.f()
74
// support redefine class/method/...
>>> class C extends A implements B { int b = 20; int f() => b; }
>>> c.f()
21
```

### Demo 2: Sample workflow

Surely, you do not *have to* use it like this. It is just a workflow that I personally feel comfortable when working with IPython/Juypter.

Suppose we have `my_app.dart` with some code, probably edited inside an IDE:

```dart
class Counter {
  int count = 0;
  String greet() => 'Hi Tom, you have count $count!';
}
```

Play with it a bit:

```dart
$ interactive --directory path/to/my/package
>>> import 'my_app.dart';
>>> counter = Counter();
>>> counter.count = 10;
>>> counter.greet()
Hi Tom, you have count 10!
>>> counter.count = 20;
>>> counter.greet()
Hi Tom, you have count 20!
```

Then we realize something wrong and want to change it:

```dart
(change "Tom" to "Alex" inside `my_app.dart`)
```

Continue playing with it (auto hot reloaded, and state preserved):

```dart
>>> counter.greet()
Hi Alex, you have count 20!
```

We can also use all dependencies in the package as well, since the REPL code is just like a normal code file in this package.

```dart
>>> import 'package:whatever_package';
>>> functionInWhateverPackage();
```

## ðŸŽ¼ Getting started

Install (just standard procedure of installing global dart packages):

```shell
dart pub global activate interactive
```

Use (just a normal binary):

```shell
interactive
```

And play with it :)

## Detailed functionality list

### Expressions

```dart
>>> a = 'Hello'; b = ' world!'; 
>>> '$a, $b'                   
Hello,  world!
```

### Statements

```dart
>>> print(a)
Hello
```

<small>(All methods, not only `print`)</small>

### Functions

#### Define and redefine

```dart
>>> String f() => 'old';
>>> f()
old
>>> String f() => 'new';
>>> f()
new
```

#### Use local and global variables

```dart
>>> a = 10;
>>> int f() { int b = 20; a++; b++; return a+b; }
>>> f() 
32
>>> f()
33
```

### Classes

#### Define and redefine, preserving states

```dart
>>> class C { int a = 10; int f() => a * 2; }
>>> c = C(); print(c.f());
20
>>> class C { int a = 1000; int f() => a * 3; }
>>> c.f()
30
```

<small>Remark: This follows the Dart hot reload semantics.</small>

#### Extends and implements

```dart
>>> class A { int f() => 10; } class B extends A { int f() => 20; }
>>> A().f() + B().f()
30
>>> class B implements A { int f() => 30; }
>>> A().f() + B().f()
40
```

#### Use local variables, fields, and global variables

```dart
>>> a = 10;
>>> class C { int b = 20; int f() { int c = 30; a++; b++; c++; return a+b+c; } }
>>> c = C(); print(c.f()); print(c.f());
63
65
```

### Add libraries as dependency

Use `!dart pub add package_name`, just like what is done in Python (Jupyter/IPython).

```dart
>>> join('directory', 'file.txt')
(...error, since have not added that dependency...)
>>> !dart pub add path
Resolving dependencies...

+ path 1.8.2

Changed 1 dependency!

>>> join('directory', 'file.txt')
(...error, since have imported it...)
>>> import 'package:path/path.dart';
>>> join('directory', 'file.txt')   
directory/file.txt
```

### Imports

#### Built-in package

```dart
>>> Random().nextInt(100)
(some error outputs here, because it is not imported)
>>> import "dart:math";
>>> Random().nextInt(100)
9
```

#### Third party package

Note: If it has not been added to dependency, please follow instructions above and use `!dart pub add path` to add it.

```dart
>>> join('directory', 'file.txt')
(...error, since have imported it...)
>>> import 'package:path/path.dart';
>>> join('directory', 'file.txt')   
directory/file.txt
```

### Multiple in one go

```dart
>>> int g() => 42; class C { int a = 10; int f() => a * 2; }
>>> C().f() + g()
62
```

### Multi line if not ended

(The `...`, instead of `>>>`, appears in the two lines, because the package detects it is not finished.)

```dart
>>> class C {
...   int a = 10;
... }
>>> 
```

### Run commands

Use prefix `!`.

```dart
>>> !whoami
tom
>>> !date
2022-10-22 ...outputs...
```

### Execute within environment of existing package

```dart
interactive --directory path/to/your/package
```

## Implementation

General:

* Create a blank package and an isolate as execution workspace
* Extract imports/classes/functions/etc using analyzer, with replacing when it has the same name, and synthesize a dart file - thus supports rich Dart feature
* Trigger Dart's hot-reload after the dart file is updated
* Use analyzer to distinguish expressions/statements/compilation-units and do corresponding transformation
* The only thing to let Dart VM service to evaluate is `generatedMethod()`, and do not evaluate anything more
* Adding dependencies is as simple as running standard shell command

As for "global" variables:

* Indeed implemented by a field variable
* Statements: Make it inside `extension on dynamic { Object? generatedMethod() { ...the statements... } }` to access it seamlessly
* Functions: Convert functions to extension methods on dynamic to access it seamlessly
* Classes: Synthesize getters/setters in classes, and delegate to the field variables, whenever there is a potential access to global variable to access it seamlessly

TODO more implementation discussions if people are interested (above is so brief)
